quickMFCC - C++20 library for computing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
Version 0.9 - 2 February 2023

Implementation based on ะก libMFCC library https://github.com/jsawruk/libmfcc. QuickMFCC uses modern C++ features like constexpr to speed up computation. 

It approximately 20x faster than original library. Average performance results for computing 13 coefficients using Ryzen 5600H on 4 GHz:
libMFCC 	- 8'192'429 nanoseconds aka 8 milliseconds
quickMFCC	- 348'858 nanoseconds	aka 0.33 milliseconds
